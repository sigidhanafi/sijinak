## 🎉 Project Setup

First, set your environment variables:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

## 🫙 Docker Usage

> This Dockerfile has been set to use MySQL only. 

### 🚶‍♀️‍➡ Getting Started

To get started, you need [Docker](https://docker.com) on your computer. Next, you need to tell your PHP project how to connect to the database. Open your project's `.env` file (or the file where you keep your database settings).

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=sijinak-db
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your-database-name # or leave it as is
DB_USERNAME=your-username
DB_PASSWORD=${DB_USERNAME} # has to be the same as your username (so do not change this)
```

### 🚗 Starting the Services 

After setting your `.env` variables, you can now start runnning your Docker container using:

```
docker compose up -d --build 
```

The first time you run this, it will take a few minutes to build and download everything. After that, it will be much faster.

### 🥀 Final Steps

Once the containers are running, you need to set your project's unique key. Run this command:

```
docker compose exec app php artisan config:clear 
docker compose exec app php artisan key:generate
```

Then set up your database tables with:

```
docker compose exec app php artisan migrate
```

You only need to run the 3 commands above the first time you set up your project. Afterwards, to start your project, you'll just need to run the `docker compose up -d --build` command mentioned earlier.

### ✈️ Opening your Project

Your should now have 2 services running:

* Laravel App: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
* phpmyadmin: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

When you're done working and want to stop the Docker containers, use this command:

```
docker-compose down
```
